## Description
This project is a Hangman game in Python. The aim of the game is to guess the word generated by the computer by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts. This project was created to practice Python programming and consolidate further key concepts such as classes, loops, and user input handling using VScode. 

The main things I learnt creating this game was classes and use of methods within classes.
